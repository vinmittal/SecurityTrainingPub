thanks for going through the activities of week 1. I am sure that a lot of you are feeling good about it. Some of you have already
undertaken more intense investigation to write ldap plugins and Android Apps and also using spark and scala for big data logs
investigations. 
Lets vote for some of the projects for Week 2. I will list some of the ideas that i have. I welcome others to pitch in some ideas
as well. 

Problem : A web site has been developed and needs 2 factor authentication but developer does not know how to do it. Look 
for open source 2 factor authentication as a service and see what it takes to protect a website with an outsourced 2 factor?
Some of you should write and host such a service on the aws. Also think about OOB authentication over mobile phone.
